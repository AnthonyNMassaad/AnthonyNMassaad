👋 Hi, I’m @AnthonyNMassaad

👀 I’m interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and exploring how these technologies can solve real-world problems.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced deep learning techniques, including neural network architectures. I'm also diving into the world of reinforcement learning and how it can be applied to autonomous systems.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to AI and machine learning, especially those focused on social good, and innovative applications of AI in healthcare and finance.

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me or follow me on LinkdeIn [@AnthonyNMassaad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-nasry-massaad/) for the latest updates on my projects and interests in AI.
